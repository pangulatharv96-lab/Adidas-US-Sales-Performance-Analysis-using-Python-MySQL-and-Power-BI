CSV Dataset – Adidas US sales data

Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
Used Adidas US sales dataset containing:
Product details
Sales, profit, and units sold
Retailers and regions
Time-based data (dates)

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)
Performed using Pandas & NumPy:
Handled missing value
Removed duplicates
Corrected data types (dates, numerical values)
Created new calculated fields (profit margin, total revenue)
Standardized column names

📌 Outcome: Clean, analysis-ready dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Used Matplotlib & Seaborn to:
Analyze sales and profit distributio
Identify top-selling products and retailers
Compare regional performance
